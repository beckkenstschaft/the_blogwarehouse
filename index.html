                    Imagine a hospital where a healthy patient gets praising and 
                    attention of the doctor but the unhealthy one is neglected… 
                    yes this is the education system of today where reputation of the 
                    school or the teacher teaching is what matters rather 
                    than the knowledge of the child.<br>

                    A student upon seeing the teacher feels relaxed imagining that his/her 
                    doubts will vanish but the will to study destroys when the teacher praises 
                    the excellent student but scolds this student who waited for 
                    the teacher’s help with a pure heart and intention.
                    
                    mostly in exams , a student’s memory is tested and is then brutally judged upon 
                    the marks he got by his memory and this is where the schools today destroy the 
                    creativity and will to study of the student. His/her capabilities 
                    were now limited to the things he/she can
                     remember and not by what they are capable of.
                    
                    life is not a race but in a society we live in , life has became a race 
                    where the schools are now the host who want their publicity by 
                    good students and the ones need help are talked about
                     nowhere… but then comes the masterstroke where these students own a 
                     million dollar company and the “excellent” ones are the employees.

                    fact yet to be cleared , 
                    leaving us with a question mark of what is it , 
                    how did it form , how is it still having such 
                    powerful effect and most importantly why does 
                    it leave scientists puzzled as well as anxious about it.

                    This is the fact of the Bermuda Triangle . 
                    it is in the western 
                    part of the north Atlantic ocean. 
                    Also known as devil’s triangle , 
                    it is a place of never returning 
                    for human race. we have always heard 
                    about the airplane that flew over it but 
                    neither reached the destination nor 
                    was retrieved. This left the scientist 
                    clueless. Another major incident took place 
                    with a cargo ship whose captain’s SOS call was
                     recorded. It said that they were heading through 
                     a tremendous storm with massive waves and need 
                     help. later nobody knows where it went.

                    In the present days we are getting news 
                    that this took place because of large 
                    amount of magnetically active rocks 
                    forming its bed , hence attracting all 
                    the metal towards it . But this leaves 
                    a question on why the storms were formed 
                    which the researchers answered by saying 
                    it due to excess amount of methane .

                    This indicates towards four major things<br> 
                    1) magnetic rock bed is the reason.<br> 
                    2) methane release there in an excess<br> 
                    3) both of them exist <br>
                    4) some alien activity<br>

                    The answers are yet unknown and we all 
                    should’nt probably give a thought of visiting it.

                    Giving a thought in the most neglected region of the 
                    human race or possibly a thought on what Stephen
                     Hawking could have proved to us . Yes this is the 
                     theory of a parallel 
                    universe. W still believe that it is a hypothetical 
                    situation with no scientific proofs but the same we 
                    thought for the black hole whose existence was proved
                    by Hawkins before his death.

                    So what is exactly a parallel universe and what
                     makes scientists so anxious about it. Well its 
                     because its theories show that in this universe 
                     time runs backward. who knows maybe a zebra crossing 
                     the road at a human crossing… or humans actually keeping
                      the environment clear… probably.
                    
                    It is known as a parallel universe for the 
                    existence of its parallel dimensions which makes 
                    it hard for us to discover it with the current technological
                     know how . It still lies in the box of the most
                      entangled thoughts of anyone.

                    An Artist have a very different vision of life. unlike us an 
                    Artist will not be bothered of what others think because all he 
                    care about is to link itself wit the supreme positive energy . 
                    An Artist will have a vision which we cannot see a vision which sees the 
                    reason of who we are and why we are here . An Artist knows… 
                    An Artist always knows 
                    how to drive his aura into something positive , can drive his 
                    energy into something non 
                    living making it the “some thing” that provides us peace 
                    making us rich with an ultimate positive energy .

                    undefined Lets go with a guitarist . A person , an artist who 
                    drives his positivity 
                    on the man made and inanimate cords of the guitar for his own joy
                     and satisfaction but 
                    end up making an infinite positive energy flow through the audience , 
                    each beat lifting the 
                    tempo of the positive wavering inside the audience and ultimately 
                    establishing shatterproof 
                    link with the soul and the ultimate driving force in them .
                    
                    Recognising the artist inside us will eventually help us stay stress 
                    free and positive that too almost in every situation . especially in this
                     infuriating pandemic and lockdown span .

                    We have been seeing movies and also been reading 
                    books about aliens invading the Earth.. 
                    Moreover all of us have at least played one video game depicting that a 
                    hero is fighting from scary creatures and saving everyone and so on…

                    So what are basically aliens and why is everyone so afraid of them visiting us. 
                    All of us know about dictators who were cruel beyond limit and 
                    found their satisfaction in the suffering of innocents. 
                    In the same way we imagine that if aliens visit us , they 
                    shall also treat us the same way the dictators did but without any 
                    communication with them how are we so sure about it.

                    The Pentagon , USA recently published its confirm report on 
                    spotting a UFO ( Unidentified Flying Object ). During the pandemic era 
                    it was another overrated news being aired but deep down all of us had a 
                    thought that if its true then we can face another trouble apart from the virus 
                    but we never gave a thought that they could just be an 
                    evolved version of us did we…

                    Still not confirmed weather an alien invasion can be helpful or devastating 
                    as hell. Feel free to share your thought on this in the comments . I believe 
                    it would be amazing if aliens visit us.
